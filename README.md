Hello! - Still figuring this out, clearly, but ig this is where intro stuff goes...

Online wise I am Muggy, so y'know thats what to call me - unless you're a friend with a certain nickname for me!

As stated in my bio I play Pony Town, some have seen me around but I just made this thingy so ehh

Anyways - If you're a proshipper or anything like them pls inform me before interacting, as I don't completley agree with MOST of that and would prefer not to be involved with anyone who indulges in liking children or is into incest relationships, it just makes me a little uncomfortable from personal experiences - thats all.

As far as Pony Town things go, I'm fine with all sorts of things aside from being covered or hidden - So talking, whispering, poking, cuddling, and all that is OK!

I'm not actually online much and when I am i'm most likely AFK (Meaning: Away/Afar from Keyboard, just means not here rlly)

Thats sorta it tbh, but if you wanna find me on Ponytown I'm usually by the bakery!

~ Charaters I play as range from anything DC to anything Marvel rlly, recently been playing Jedediah and a few Invincible characters!

(Plsss don't copy any of my ponies - You can take inspo, WITH PERMISSION!)
