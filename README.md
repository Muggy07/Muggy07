Hello! - Still figuring this out, clearly, but ig this is where intro stuff goes...

Online wise I am Muggy, so y'know thats what to call me - unless you're a friend with a certain nickname for me!

As stated in my bio I play Pony Town, some have seen me around but I just made this thingy so ehh

Anyways, plss dni if you're a proshipper, OR at least tell me if you are one as I don't agree with most of that stuff and would prefer not to be involved with anyone who indulges in the really bad parts of it, it just makes me uncomfortable from personal experiences - thats all.

As far as Pony Town things go, I'm fine with all sorts of things aside from being covered or hidden - So talking, whispering, poking, cuddling, and all that is OK!

I'm not actually online much and when I am i'm most likely AFK (Meaning: Away/Afar from Keyboard, just means not here rlly)

Thats sorta it tbh, but if you wanna find me on Ponytown I'm usually by the bakery!

~ Charaters I play as range from anything DC to anything Marvel rlly, recently been playing Jedediah and a few Invincible characters!

(Plsss don't copy any of my ponies - You can take inspo, WITH PERMISSION!)
