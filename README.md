Hello! - I'm still figuring this out, but I suppose this is where intro stuff goes...

~ Online wise I am Muggy, so that's what you can call me - UNLESS you're a friend with a certain nickname for me!

( As stated in my bio and strawpage, I am 18 and I play Pony Town - as of right now I am currently in a lot of fandoms... )

  - PLS inform me of any triggers you might have BEFORE properly interacting with me, it's just so I may keep them in mind when chatting!

As far as Pony Town things go, I'm fine with all sorts of things aside from being covered or copied - So talking, whispering, poking, cuddling, and all that is OK! (further dni's and so on are on my Strawpage, if you're interested!)

- I'm not actually online much and when I am i'm most likely AFK (Meaning: Away/Afar from Keyboard, just means not here really)

Thats sorta it tbh, but if you wanna find me on Ponytown I'm usually by the bakery and if you'd like to know more you can always check my strawpage! (it's still a work in progress though)

~ Charaters I play as range from anything DC to anything Marvel rlly, I do make new characters daily tho so that may change!!

(Plsss don't copy ANY of my ponies - You can take inspo, WITH PERMISSION! Also please take into consideration that I am 18 years old and am not at all comfortable having weird convos and or relationships with those younger than me!)
